  <div class="content-container">
    <div class="question"> What is the return policy?</div>
    <div class="answer">  A return policy is a document that outlines the rules for returning purchased goods or services.These policies often include refund information, returns requirements, timeframes, and customer support contact information.</div>
  </div>
<div class="content-container">
  <div class="question">How long do I have?</div>
  <div class="answer">One thing customers will always look for in your policy is the length of your return window.
    Not only do they want to know how much time they’ll have to make a decision, but customers also use the length of the window as an indication of how flexible your brand will be if anything were to go wrong.</div>
    </div>
<div class="content-container">
  <div class="question"> Where do I start?</div>
  <div class="answer">Some return policies don’t actually make it clear how to start the return process.
     This usually happens because the instructions are buried in a wall of text or the information lives on a different page. 
     As you can imagine, this is a frustrating experience for customers.</div>
    </div>
<div class="content-container">
  <div class="question"> How long will it take?</div>
  <div class="answer">Customers will feel anxious if they send off their return items and don’t hear any updates for weeks, or understand what the expected timeline is. Did the item make it back to the warehouse? When will they see their money back in their account? If your return policy clearly outlines expected timeframes, your customer support team will stop getting swamped with these types of questions.</div>
